# IntelliJ-Jenkins-DSL-Skeleton
skeleton structure for writing Jenkins DSL


this repository is a skeleton structure for writing jenkinsdsl in IntelliJ IDE.
IntelliJ is the only officially supported IDE for JenkinsDSL (as far as I know). 
However compatability is still quite tidious to achieve...

So I created this repository that includes a **gradle build**. 


### How to use this repository
------------------------------

**Pre-Requirements:**

this skeleton project assumes you have the following things already installed on your system:

* Java
* Gradle (you could us a gradle wrapper, but this has not been tested by me)
* IntelliJ

all you have to do is **git clone** this skeleton and open the gradle build with intelliJ
